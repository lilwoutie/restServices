# Food Supplier Service

This service represents a RESTful API for a food supplier, developed using Spring Boot. It allows you to manage food items with properties such as name, item description, price, and delivery status.

## Data Model

Each food item has the following properties:

- `id` (Long): Unique identifier for the item.
- `name` (String): Name of the food item.
- `description` (String): Description of the food item.
- `price` (Double): Price of the food item.
- `delivered` (Boolean): Delivery status of the item.

## API Endpoints

```
GET /items
```

Returns a list of all food items.

### Get a single item by ID

```
GET /items/{id}
```

Returns the item with the specified ID.

### Add a new item

```
POST /items
```

**Request body:**
```json

  "name": "Pizza",
  "description": "Large pepperoni pizza",
  "price": 12.99,
  "delivered": false
}
```

### Update an existing item

```
PUT /items/{id}
```

**Request body:**
```json

}
```

### Delete an item

```

 REST Order Service ‚Äì API Overview

This service provides basic CRUD operations for handling orders. It's designed for use as a supplier in a distributed food ordering system.
üì¶ Base URL

http://localhost:8082

üìå Endpoints Summary (Before Distributed 2PC Coordination)
### üõí Order Management (/orders)
Method	Endpoint	Description	Request Body
GET	/orders	Get all orders	‚Äì
GET	/orders/{id}	Get an order by ID	‚Äì

PUT	/orders/{id}	Update an order by ID	{"customerName": "...", "delivered": true}
üîÑ 2PC-like Transaction API (/transaction)

These endpoints simulate basic two-phase commit behavior (single-service only):

POST	/transaction/prepare	Stage an order for a transaction	?transactionId=... + order JSON body
POST	/transaction/commit	Commit a previously staged order	?transactionId=...
