 REST Order Service ‚Äì API Overview

This service provides basic CRUD operations for handling orders. It's designed for use as a supplier in a distributed food ordering system.
üì¶ Base URL

http://localhost:8082

üìå Endpoints Summary (Before Distributed 2PC Coordination)
### üõí Order Management (/orders)
Method	Endpoint	Description	Request Body
GET	/orders	Get all orders	‚Äì
GET	/orders/{id}	Get an order by ID	‚Äì
POST	/orders	Create a new order	{"customerName": "...", "delivered": false}
DELETE	/orders/{id}	Delete an order by ID	‚Äì
PUT	/orders/{id}	Update an order by ID	{"customerName": "...", "delivered": true}
üîÑ 2PC-like Transaction API (/transaction)

These endpoints simulate basic two-phase commit behavior (single-service only):
Method	Endpoint	Description	Request Body / Params
POST	/transaction/prepare	Stage an order for a transaction	?transactionId=... + order JSON body
POST	/transaction/commit	Commit a previously staged order	?transactionId=...
POST	/transaction/rollback	Rollback a staged transaction	?transactionId=...

‚ö† Note: commit or rollback must reference the same transactionId used in the prepare.
