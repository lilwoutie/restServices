# Supplier REST Service ‚Äì 2PC Compatible API

This project implements a **Supplier Service** in a distributed food-ordering system. It supports the **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)** protocol, allowing a broker or coordinator to manage distributed transactions across multiple services.

## üîÑ Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Operations

### 3. Prepare a Transaction (Stage an Order)

```bash
curl -X POST http://52.178.15.136:8081/transaction/prepare/txn123      -H "Content-Type: application/json"      -d '{
           "productId": 1,
           "quantity": 2
         }'
```

### 4. Commit a Transaction

```bash
curl -X POST http://52.178.15.136:8081/transaction/commit/txn123
```

### 5. Rollback a Transaction

```bash
curl -X POST http://52.178.15.136:8081/transaction/rollback/txn123
```

### 6. View All Staged Transactions (Debug Only)

```bash
curl http://52.178.15.136:8081/transaction/staged
```

## ü§ñ Broker Coordination Tips

To integrate this service into a distributed system with a **2PC broker**, follow this general coordination protocol:

### 1. **Prepare Phase**

For each involved service (like this supplier):

- The broker sends a `POST /transaction/prepare/{txnId}` with order details.
- Wait for `200 OK` if the supplier accepts the staged order.
- If any service returns a `4xx`, **abort the entire transaction**.

### 2. **Commit Phase**

If **all participants** responded with `200 OK` to the prepare:

- The broker sends `POST /transaction/commit/{txnId}` to each participant.

### 3. **Rollback Phase**

If **any participant failed** during the prepare phase:

- The broker sends `POST /transaction/rollback/{txnId}` to **all participants who prepared**.

### 4. **Idempotency & Error Handling**

- All 2PC endpoints are **idempotent**:
  - Re-sending the same `commit` or `rollback` will not cause errors or duplicates.
- The broker may safely retry operations if it missed a response.
- Edge cases like reused `txnId` with different content return HTTP 409 (Conflict).

### 5. **Service Unavailability**

- If the supplier is down during `commit` or `rollback`, the broker should retry until successful.
- Optionally implement **logging** or persistent staging to recover transactions.

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

You can test the flow as follows:

1. Check current product inventory.
2. Prepare a transaction using a unique ID.
3. Verify the staged update using `/transaction/staged`.
4. Commit or rollback the transaction.
5. Re-check the product inventory.
